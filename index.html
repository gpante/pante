          <h3>Student Director</h3><br>
          Adventure Learning Programs (ALPs) is a group on campus that facilitates workshops that challenges individuals to learn about themselves through experiential education and adventure based learning. In doing so, participants improve their teamwork, communication, and trust with each other.<br>
          As a Student Director, I was responsible for daily needs such as interfacing with workshop requestors, delegating tasks to other project teams, and holding meetings within ALPs leadership to improve our internal and external programming. In addition, I aided in long term goals such as staff hiring, training, and collaborating with other organizations<br><br>

          <div class="content">
            <p>
            	In ALPs, I was heading the organization of approximately 55 other students with 2 other co-directors. While we would often share responsibilities, I was primarily tasked with organizational and logistical tasks within the office. I extended my computer science background into ALPs by developing more efficient solutions to our tasks. These innovations include:
            		<ul>
            			<li>Creating graphics and data visualizations for our biannual budget presentation (99.6% of our $190k budget had been approved!)</li>
            			<li>Automating a Google Calendar to populate with workshop dates for our facilitators and our clients</li>
            			<li>Using Google Scripts to automate processes including facilitator staffing, spreadsheet presentation/styling, and intraorganizational outreach</li>
            		</ul>
              Organizational skills I've learned as a Student Director include interfacing with each of our committees (Staff Training, Internal Affairs, Marketting, Diversity & Inclusion, and Program Development) to give them the tools they need to succeed, hosting meetings with the full-time staff advisor and the committee heads, and documenting notes from each meeting. In the event these committee heads needed information from the rest of our staff, I would poll, organize, and aggregate the data for their individual uses.

          <h3>Facilitator</h3><br>
            As a facilitator, I would be assigned a group for which I would host a workshop. To do so, I would reach out to the requestor, hold a meeting to assess their group, plan a workshop that suits their needs and group state, and execute the workshop with other fellow facilitators.
            <br><br>

            <div class="content">
              <p>Being a facilitator, we are all trained in the ideologies of experiential education (learning through doing) and the experential learning cycle, which helps transitions ideas or skills learned through games and activities into real world applications. Additionally, we were all trained with up-to-date safety protocols on ropes courses ranging from 1 foot to 45 feet off the ground as well as a variety of speciality elements including ziplines, Giant's Swing, and the Quadraphenia.<br><br>
              While I was primarily responsible for executing workshops, I've also shown initiative through various other forms of involvement. In my time as a facilitator, I've partcipated in:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><u>Program Development Committee:</u> Brainstorm and implement new ways to improve our programming such as new workshop types, new props, or new activities that met every other week to discuss our projects</li>
                <li><u>Hiring Committee:</u> Create and advertise an application for the facilitator role, review and interview applications and applicants, and onboard the new hires into ALPs. As a director, I've also taken the role of training the hiring committees that have come after me.</li>
                <li><u>Lead Facilitating:</u> Taking charge of individal workshop logistics such as hosting meetings with the requestor for their goals, leading the planning of the workshop with fellow facilitators, organizing safety forms and waivers, and debriefing the workshop to improve our programming in the future.
              </ul>

              <h3>B.S. Computer Science & B.S. Communication Arts</h3><br>
              My time at UW Madison was primarily focused on Computer Science with a secondary focus in Communication Arts. Here, I learned CS basics in Java, Python, Data Structures, and Algorithms while also exploring advanced topics such as Machine Learning, Data Science, and Artifical Intelligence.<br>Due to the importance of teams and collaborative work, I've also pursued a major in communications. In communications, I've studied the psychology of interpersonal communication, group dynamics, and decision making.

                <p>In my undergraduate experience, I have found the Filipino American Student Organization (FASO), and I've been able to devote a lot of my time and passion into this organization. Joining as a member in my first year, I was quickly inspired by the community and cameraderie within this organization and as a result, it has become a core part of my experience at UW. As a member of the executive board, we were responsible for hosting events that taught about Filipino culture and community, and sharing that with the campus at large. Below are the positions I've been elected to on FASO's executive board:<br>
                  <ul>
                    <li><u>Fundraising Chair:</u> During my second year, I was FASO's fundraising chair. My responsibilities included brainstorming, organizing, and executing fundraising events. Examples of events were: selling Tsokolate (Filipino Hot Chocolate), Smash Bros Tournament, and selling Halo-Halo (Filipino Dessert).</li>
                    <li><u>Vice President:</u> Becoming Student Director my third year, I had to split my time between the two organizations. My role as Vice President was to serve as an intermediary between the board and the general body, as well as between the presidents and the rest of the board. I would help each individual chair by holding check-in meetings each month, while also checking in casually more frequently. As we were all close-knit on board, I had to tread the line between authority and friend frequently, and I've learned to balance the two accordingly.</li>
                    <li><u>Advisor:</u> In my final year of undergrad, I was chosen as the advisor for the upcoming executive board. This purpose of this role was to help guide the new board without taking charge; allowing them to grow and create new ideas but with the safety of avoiding old mistakes. Responsibilities included deadline reminders for grants, and providing historical knowledge for different events or processes.</li>
